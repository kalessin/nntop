Description
===========

Higher level Neural Network lib on top of Tensorflow.

Why?
====

There are other longly developed libs for doing higher level NN programming (i.e. `Keras <https://keras.io/>`_). The Purpose of this library
is not to replace or be used as alternative for them. This is just a personal project as I prefer to develop my own library for learning
purposes, without loosing sense of what is happening at lower level.
